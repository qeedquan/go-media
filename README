Various Go libraries for multimedia stuff.

These libraries is for my personal projects, no API stability at all.

Windows note:
Easiest way to install mingw is to install msys2
http://www.msys2.org/
Download the exe and then after installation, msys2 comes with
the package manager pacman. GCC and various other build tools
exists as packages that can be installed.

Use CPATH for include path in environment variables
